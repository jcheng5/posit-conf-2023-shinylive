## Shiny is easy...

## ...until it's not

. . .

Deployment is hard!

::: incremental
- Your code needs a server to run on
- With the appropriate version of R or Python
- With the right system dependencies and packages installed
- With a copy of your app code and data
:::

## Our best attempts at simplifying deployment

- [ShinyApps.io](https://shinyapps.io) for free or paid cloud hosting
- [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/) for on-premises enterprise hosting

. . .

Excellent for businesses, or apps with light to moderate traffic.

But expensive for hobbyists or freelancers with potentially high traffic.

## Can we remove the R or Python server altogether?

Some different approaches:

::: incremental
- **Send your app code and data to users, and have them run it locally.**  
Awful install experience, problematic security implications.
- **Rewrite your app in pure JavaScript.**  
Painful development learning curve, no access to R and Python packages.
- **Create an R/Python process _inside_ the browser, and run the app there.**  
Simply impossible, until recently...

# WebAssembly (wasm)

## What is wasm?

::: incremental
- For years, browsers' only native tongue was JavaScript
- Now, browsers all speak JavaScript _and_ wasm
- JavaScript is designed for humans to write, wasm is designed for compilers to emit
- Write code in C/C++, compile to wasm, and run it in the browser!
:::

## I was wrong about wasm!

. . .

"Their" reasoning:

::: incremental
- Shiny is written in R
- R is written in C/C++
- C/C++ can be compiled to wasm
- Shiny can be compiled to wasm, QED
:::

. . .

My response: "Well, _actually_..."

## Porting is even more difficult than it seems

Some fairly basic computing capabilities are just not available in the browser!

::: incremental
- Cannot launch a process
- Cannot open a network connection
- Cannot perform synchronous I/O (e.g. fetch a web page)
- Cannot handle interrupt signals (e.g. Ctrl-C)
:::

. . .

wasm doesn't change these limitations, it just makes them hurt more.

## Some people are just built different

- Joe Cheng: "Stop suggesting we port everything to wasm! It's never going to work!"

## July 2022: Shinylive for Python

## **Sept 2023:** Shinylive for R!!! {.confetti}

# How to use Shinylive

## Several different options are available

::: incremental
* Convert
* Fiddle
* Include
:::

## Option 1: Convert

{shinylive}: Convert local Shiny app to static HTML/CSS/JS/wasm

(TODO: Diagram: app.R -> `> shinylive::export()` -> index.html + assets)
(TODO: Diagram: app.py -> `$ shinylive export` -> index.html + assets)

## Option 1: Convert

Caveat: For browser security reasons, you can't just double-click index.html to run it locally. You need a real web server. Fortunately, both R and Python have one-liners to start a web server for a directory.

<br>

### Shiny for R:
```r
> shinylive::export(app_dir="myapp", output_dir="site")
> httpuv::runStaticServer("site")
```

<br>

### Shiny for Python:
```python
$ shinylive export myapp site
$ cd site
$ python -m http.server 8000
```

## Option 2: Fiddle

Shinylive.io: Write and share Shiny apps directly in the browser

1. Browse examples
2. Create your own
3. Share via URL
4. Save to GitHub gist

## Option 2: Fiddle

## Option 3: Include

quarto-shinylive: Static Shiny apps as Quarto code chunks

## New uses for Shiny

- Shiny for Python tutorial is all shinylive
- Shiny for Python function reference docs embed example apps
- pkgdown sites for R could use Shiny apps to demonstrate package functionality

## New uses for Shiny

Your turn!

::: incremental
- Would your last presentation have been more compelling with some interactivity?
- Would your blog posts be more powerful if they featured interactive apps?
- Could your package's documentation benefit from Shiny apps?
:::

## Recap

* **Convert**: Use the {shinylive} package to convert app.R/app.py to static HTML
* **Fiddle**: Visit [https://shinylive.io/py/](https://shinylive.io/py/) or [https://shinylive.io/r/](https://shinylive.io/r/) to start writing and running Shiny apps in the browser
* **Include**: Use quarto-shinylive to embed Shiny apps in Quarto documents, presentations, and websites


## Limitations

- Slower startup time, larger download size
- Not all of CRAN or PyPI is available
- Some functions just don't work (R: `system()` and `{future}`, Python: `multiprocessing`)
- Can't connect directly to databases (but API calls may work)
- Code/data is fully visible to users

## Thank you!
